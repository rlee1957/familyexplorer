Thank you for deciding to participate in the BUCK$ system. Here is a list of things you need to do to get started.
1) Review your postage information to ensure that your name and address are correct. Do so by clicking the Postage Information link. If your postage information is not correct, please correct the information. This information is important because you will want the contributions to go to you, at your correct address. 
2) Review your Personal (Promo) Code and ensure that it is what you want it to be by clicking the "My Promo Code" link. Once you have advanced to level 1, you cannot change your Personal (Promo) Code. Promo code is very important because it is what you send with your contributions and also what new users enter to join your team.
3) Review your Email information and ensure that it is correct. Do so by clicking the Verify Email link. Email is also very important because if you forget your login information, you can enter your email and your personal (promo) code to have your username and password emailed to you.
4) Now that you have verified your information you will want to advance to level 1. Do so by clicking the Advance to level 1 link. Advancing to level 1 is important because in order to have contributions directed to you, you must be at level 1.
5) Invite others to participate in the BUCK$ system using your Personal (Promo) Code. Those who decide to participate in the BUCK$ system using your Personal (Promo) Code will automatically be placed on your team. You will receive a contribution from each of your team members who advance to level 1.
6) Whenever you receive donations then acknowledge reciept of the donation by clicking the Acknowledge Receipt link.
