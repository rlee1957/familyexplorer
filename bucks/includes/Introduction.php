<h3>A little about <?php echo($lang["application"]); ?></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<?php echo($lang["application"]); ?> is a web assisted contributions system. The web application enrolls members, assigns teams and directs activities. Tools are provided to help with correspondence. Members are responsible for maintaining their activities online. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Candidates are directed to the web application by invitation only. They enroll online by providing their name, email address, postal address and by creating a username and password. When a candidate is invited he/she is provided a <?php echo($lang["team_code"]); ?> by a member/host who sent them the invitation. That <?php echo($lang["team_code"]); ?> is also required at enrollment. A candidate enrolls by clicking the "Sign Up" button and filling in the appropriate information. Instructions are given where needed.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After successfully enrolling, you will become a member and you will be given further instructions. Your goal is to become a <?php echo($lang["cb_prefix"]); ?>. Once you have advanced to a <?php echo($lang["cb_prefix"]); ?>, you have the opportunity to invite others to be part of your team.
